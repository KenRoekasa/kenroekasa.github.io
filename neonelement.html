            <h1>Neon Element</h1>

            <p>Neon Element is an isometric free-for-all arena brawler game supporting up to 4 players. Each player can switch to 4 elemental states Earth, Fire, Air and Water during a match. Different elements have strengths and weaknesses against the other elements creating an element of tactical gameplay in each match, as players must be quick to swap elemental states to counter their opponents. The game can be played alone with up to 3 AI opponents, or online with up to 4 players.</p>

            <p>Local matches feature 4 gamemodes (Deathmatch, Timed, King of the Hill, Regicide), with networked matches featuring the same set of game modes, minus the regicide mode. Each player is has a light attack, heavy attack and a shield that they can use, along with the elemental swapping, to defeat their opponents. The game features Power ups which spawn throughout each match, allowing players to chance the tide of the battle.</p>

            <p>The game has been made as an entirely collaborative effort between our team, with sections being worked on both individually and in pairs or small groups. This document details our efforts, and the technologies and techniques we have applied to create Neon Element.</p>
